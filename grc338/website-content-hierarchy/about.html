                    <p> Sunshine Florist was created by a 2010 Cal Poly, SLO graduate and is run by a team of Cal Poly grads as well as current students. Our team has a wide range of backgrounds including graphic design, event planning, graphic communication, and more. We strive to bring our clients memorable arrangements that shine wherever they are. Each piece is made with extra care and the freshest flowers. We highly encourage community members as well as those along the central coast to reach out to us for a service like no other. </p>
