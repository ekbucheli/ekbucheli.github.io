            <h2>Your Baking Pans Can Make or Break Your Recipe</h2>
            <p>You probably have more than one baking pan at home if you had been baking for awhile now. I have accumulated quite a lot actually more than what I really need. Some of them I bought in impulse, a leisurely walk in the mall gave me few more extra new pans. I have glass, ceramic, aluminum, stainless and silicone. I  never paid much attention on how each of these types of pan affects my baking, all I know is that I love the pan. Yes, the type of pans you use in baking affects the end baked product. With so many baking pans available now, how do you know which one to buy and use for which type of baking? That’s were our lesson today comes in.</p>
            <h4>
               Aluminum Pans
            </h4>
            <p>This pan distributes heat well, and is not that expensive. When buying aluminum pans, look for pans labelled as anodized aluminum, this pan has been treated to make it very durable and semi non-stick. There are two types: Silver Anodized and Hard Anodized. Best for baking breads, cakes, cookies, muffins, tarts</p>
            <h4>
               Glass Pans
            </h4>
            <p>Glass pans conducts heat well but it heat up slowly and do not distribute heat evenly. Recipes that uses a lot of sugar like cakes and cookie bars might start to burn before it gets cooked all way inside. The standard advice when baking in glass pan is to lower the temperature by 25F from what the recipe calls for and increase baking time by minutes longer. Best for casseroles and savory dishes or cobblers and crisp.</p>

            <h4>
               Ceramic Pans
            </h4>
            <p>Ceramic is similar to glass pan, it is also a good conductor of heat but can also cause to over browning of baked products that are high in sugar.Usage: Best for casseroles and savory dishes or cobblers and crisp , pie. 
            </p>
            <h4>
               Silicone Pans 
            </h4>
            <p>Silicone Pan are not a good heat conductor, so baked products tends to be lighter in color. But it has an advantage of no having to worry about the bake product sticking to the pan, plus it is easy to remove. light colored cakes, breads and muffins when sticking is an issue. </p>
            <h4>
               Iron Skillet Pans 
            </h4>
            <p>Iron skillet pan can withstand high oven temperatures, it is tough and durable. This type of pan stay hot longer. Best for searing meat, bread (like corn bread, skillet pizza or focaccia bread), dutch baby pancakes, skillet cookie, casserole.</p>

            <h4>
               Dark Pan vs. Light Pan
            </h4>
            <p>When I started baking, I never knew about these information I was sharing you. This led me to accumulating so much baking pans that are totally unnecessary. I bought a lot of dark non stick pans, they definitely look better, and it is non stick so why not? Little did I know that the pan color do affect how the recipe turn out. We are not talking about color like red, blue, green etc. We are talking about dark or light colored pan, the likes of non-stick pan and light aluminum pans. So why does it matter and why should we concern about it?
               This of it this way. You know why it is not advisable to wear black when the weather is hot and humid? because black or dark color absorbs heat, and this goes the same with baking pans. The darker the pan, the more it absorbs heat, and more heat means darker end product. Light colored pans (aluminum pans) on the other hand reflects heat. Dark pans are great for when you want to develop a nice browning, like when making breads, or crust. You certainly do not want to use it when baking delicate baked goods like cookies or cakes, more so for cakes that you want to flip and have the bottom facing up when serving. If you are using a dark pan or baking sheet, pay close attention to monitor the browning so you can do necessary steps to prevent to much browning of top.
               Metal pans are what is more recommend when it comes to baking, 95% of my baking pans are metal, some are light and some are dark. Metals pans conducts and distributes heat better. Depending on whether you use light or dark pan, you can have a nicely browned bake product to a golden brown crust.
